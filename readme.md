# Search Params

Read and write [URLSearchParams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) with full type-safety using `@search-params/react` using any React Framework and any schema validation library.

## Documentation

For usage please reference `@search-params/react` [readme.md](/packages/react/readme.md) for more detailed information.

## Development

### Installation

The Search Params repository uses [PNPM Workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) and [Turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo). To install dependencies, run in the project's root directory:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

You can also test/debug `@search-params/react` with the docs locally. Any change to the docs will re-render instantly. If you update the package, a rebuild is required but using Turborepo this has been set to watch mode.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```
