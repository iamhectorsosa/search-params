## Development

### Installation

The Search Params repository uses [PNPM Workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) and [Turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo). To install dependencies, run `pnpm install` in the project root directory.

### Development

You can also test/debug `@search-params/react` with the docs locally. Any change to the docs will re-render instantly. If you update the package, a rebuild is required but using Turborepo this has been set to watch mode.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```
